Bikes parking demo app
======================

Task description
----------------
You are given a CSV dataset that contains the coordinates of all the bike parking in San Francisco. Put this data on a map of San Francisco. Feel free to use any languages, libraries, and technologies as you see fit. Also, feel free to be as creative as you'd like.

_Extra credit:_ make it interactive -- for example, add the ability to click a bike parking location to see details about it.

_Extra extra credit:_ aggregate the information on the map somehow, by adding something like clustering or heatmap, but still retaining the ability to pinpoint individual locations.
